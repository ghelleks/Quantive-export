## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Create Google Apps Script Project**
   - [ ] Navigate to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - [ ] Create new project with descriptive name
   - [ ] Save project successfully

2. **Install Code**
   - [ ] Copy complete `Code.gs` content to project
   - [ ] Verify no syntax errors in Apps Script editor
   - [ ] Save project and confirm no compilation errors

### Step 2: Configuration
1. **API Credentials Setup**
   ```
   Required Properties:
   - [ ] QUANTIVE_API_TOKEN: [Your API token]
   - [ ] QUANTIVE_ACCOUNT_ID: [Your account ID]
   - [ ] SESSION_ID: [Target session ID]
   ```

2. **Output Configuration** (Choose one or both)
   ```
   Optional Properties:
   - [ ] GOOGLE_DOC_ID: [Document ID for formatted reports]
   - [ ] GOOGLE_SHEET_ID: [Sheet ID for data tracking]
   - [ ] LOOKBACK_DAYS: [Days for recent activity, default: 7]
   ```

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - [ ] Run `setupConfiguration()` function for guided setup, OR
   - [ ] Manually set script properties in Project Settings
   - [ ] Run `testConfiguration()` to verify setup

### Step 3: Testing & Validation
1. **Manual Testing**
   - [ ] Execute `testConfiguration()` - should return success
   - [ ] Execute `generateQuantiveReport()` - should create report
   - [ ] Verify output in configured Google Doc or Sheet
   - [ ] Check execution logs for any warnings or errors

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (Optional but recommended)
   - [ ] Run `runUnitTests()` - all tests should pass
   - [ ] Run `runIntegrationTests()` - end-to-end workflow should succeed
   - [ ] Run `runPerformanceTests()` - execution time should be under limits

### Step 4: Automation Setup
1. **Schedule Configuration**
   - [ ] Determine report frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - [ ] Choose appropriate time for execution
   - [ ] Consider timezone for your organization

2. **Trigger Creation**
   ```javascript
   // Example configurations:
   // Weekly Monday reports at 9 AM:
   TriggerManager.setupTimeDrivenTrigger('weekly', 9, 1);
   
   // Daily reports at 8 AM:
   TriggerManager.setupTimeDrivenTrigger('daily', 8);
   
   // Monthly reports on 1st at 10 AM:
   TriggerManager.setupTimeDrivenTrigger('monthly', 10, null, 1);
   ```

3. **Trigger Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm trigger appears in "Triggers" section of Apps Script
   - [ ] Wait for first automated execution or test manually
   - [ ] Verify automated execution creates report successfully

### Step 5: Monitoring Setup
1. **Execution Monitoring**
   - [ ] Bookmark Apps Script project for easy access
   - [ ] Set up calendar reminders to check execution logs periodically
   - [ ] Document contact information for technical support

2. **Error Alerting** (Optional)
   - [ ] Configure email notifications for script failures
   - [ ] Set up monitoring dashboard if using multiple scripts
   - [ ] Document escalation procedures for critical failures

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Week 1: Initial Monitoring
- [ ] **Day 1**: Verify first automated execution
- [ ] **Day 3**: Check execution logs for any issues
- [ ] **Day 7**: Review generated reports for data accuracy

### Week 2: Performance Validation
- [ ] **Execution Time**: Confirm reports generate within time limits
- [ ] **Data Quality**: Validate report data matches Quantive web interface
- [ ] **Automation Reliability**: Confirm scheduled triggers execute as expected

### Month 1: Operational Readiness
- [ ] **Historical Data**: Review trend data in Google Sheets (if configured)
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from report consumers
- [ ] **Maintenance Plan**: Schedule regular credential rotation and updates

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Authentication Failure** | 401/403 errors in logs | Verify API token and account ID |
| **Session Not Found** | 404 errors for session data | Check session ID and access permissions |
| **Output Failure** | Cannot write to Doc/Sheet | Verify file IDs and edit permissions |
| **Execution Timeout** | Script stops before completion | Check for network issues or large datasets |
| **Trigger Not Running** | No automated executions | Verify trigger creation and script authorization |

### Emergency Contacts
- **Script Administrator**: [Your contact information]
- **Quantive Admin**: [Quantive account administrator]
- **Google Workspace Admin**: [Google account administrator]

## Rollback Procedures

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Document the failure symptoms and error messages
   - [ ] Disable any active triggers to prevent continued failures
   - [ ] Revert to previous working configuration if available

2. **Investigation Steps**
   - [ ] Review execution logs for specific error details
   - [ ] Test configuration with `testConfiguration()` function
   - [ ] Verify API credentials and permissions haven't changed

3. **Resolution**
   - [ ] Fix identified issues following troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Re-test thoroughly before re-enabling automation
   - [ ] Update documentation with lessons learned

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- [ ] Review execution logs for errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify report generation is successful
- [ ] Monitor execution time trends

### Monthly
- [ ] Review and archive old Google Sheets data if applicable
- [ ] Check for Google Apps Script or Quantive API updates
- [ ] Validate credentials are still active and properly scoped

### Quarterly
- [ ] Review and update session IDs for new planning periods
- [ ] Update lookback periods if business requirements change
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing with updated data

### Annual
- [ ] Rotate API credentials per security policy
- [ ] Review and update automation schedules
- [ ] Evaluate feature enhancements or optimizations
